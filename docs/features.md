### Widgets
| *Obtain a specific subset of products like most sold products, new arrivals, featured products and more.*                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Widgets are components that allow to find and display products based on a set of filters. Depending on the widget type and configuration one can provide different parameters in order to filter a specific subset of products. The resulting subset of products can be used in previews, teasers, and so on. |
| **A set of default widgets is included with Searchperience. Using custom product properties for filtering requires external configuration.**                                                                                                                                  |

### Enrichments
| *Modify products ranking scores in order to make these more relevant in search results.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Through enrichments it is possible to enhance products with keywords for special sorting or to adjust their relevance score so that they are better placed inside search results. Users can configure which products to enrich by defining a set of rules that will match one or many products (higher or lower in the result set). It is also possible to apply enrichments only on certain context for example when searching for a specific brand. |
| **Active by default. No predefined enrichments are included. Using custom product properties for matching requires external configuration.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Promotions
| *Attach content or generic results to specific search terms or products properties.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Promotions allow to deliver tailored content to online shop users when searching for a specific search term or when navigating a specific part of the online shop. The custom content will only appear when users search for a configured search term or their search criteria matches a specific product property based on facets for example when searching for a specific brand. |
| **Active by default. No predefined promotions are included. Matching search terms, promotion content, time period and more can be configured in Cockpit.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Promotions Documentation](cockpit/promotions.md#promotions)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Stopwords
| *Remove specific terms from the search query.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In order to not pollute the search query and increase the reliability of search, it is possible to define a set of words that should be omitted by the search engine. Online shop users can still be able to type these words, however the search engine will not consider them. |
| **Active by default. Modern search engines include a limited list of [stopwords](glossary.md#stopword) with terms like `the`, `and`, and so on. Custom stopwords per language can be configured in Cockpit.**                                                                    |
| [Stopwords Documentation](cockpit/stopwords.md#stopwords)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Synonyms
| *Group or map similar search terms for better search reliability.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Synonyms allow to configure relationships between search terms. These relationships permit to group terms with similar meaning so that when searching for any of the terms the same search results are returned. It is also possible to create a mapping between terms so that a term will be replaced by its mapping when searching this is commonly used for acronyms. |
| **Active by default. Some example synonyms are included, however users are advised to check them and create new ones which adapt to their needs. All users.**                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Search preview 
| *Simulate searching and sorting. Analyze can compare queries.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| With search preview it is possible to check the results of a search query and analyze how different sorting affect the order of the search results. The preview functions also allow to control the ranking score of a product and determine the reason of their position in search results. |
| **Active by default. No extra configuration is needed. Advanced users only.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Crawler
| *Analyze and index web documents.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crawling of websites allows to make the content of the specific web site searchable inside Searchperience. These websites can later be included in live search and search results to allow users to navigate around the web site. It is also possible to include additional documents like PDF or Word documents. |
| **No defaults. URLs must be configured.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Livesearch
| *Provide relevant information to users even while searching.*                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Livesearch provides users search teasers based on their input. These teasers involve products, brands, suggestions, and so on and will reflect what the search is returning. |
| **Active by default.**                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Livesearch Documentation](glossary.md#livesearch)                                                                                                                           |

### Facets
| *Allow users to narrow down search results with on the fly generated navigation.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Facets provide a easy and reliable way to navigate around search results. Searchperience computes facets on the fly, which means that the data used to generate these elements represents the current state of the possible result set and therefore no empty items are displayed. Almost any product property can be used to generate facets: from size or color, to prices or stock information. |
| **Basic facets are active by default. Available facets depend on product's properties.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Facets Documentation](glossary.md#facet)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Filters
| *Filters define the scope of possible search results e.g. the current language.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Filters provide a way to obtain a narrowed subset of products, for example, every product in a given category or all products from a given retailer. Multiple filters can be combined to further narrow the subset of results. Depending on configuration some filters are available just on certain endpoints. |
| **Basic filters are active by default. Configuration is needed to extend it. Available filters depend on product's properties.**                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Filters Documentation](glossary.md#filter) - [Endpoints Documentation](glossary.md#endpoint)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Property Boosting
| *Improve visibility and findability of products with certain properties.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Through property boosting, it is possible to improve the relevance of certain products depending on specific criteria. For example, information located in the product's title can be configured to be more relevant and make the product more visible when users search for any word contained in it. Meanwhile, other properties such as the product's description is less important and a match between the users query plays a lesser role when ranking products. |
| **Basic configuration as default. Configuration is needed to extend it. Property Boosting depends on product's properties.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Time Boosting
| *Improve visibility and findability of products with certain time criteria.*                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Through time boosting, it is possible to improve the relevance of certain products depending on time related properties such as release-date, last-update-date and so on. |
| **Not active by default. Configuration is needed.**                                                                                                                       |

### Facet Sorting
| *Sort facets and even individual facets items based on custom business criteria.*                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The facet sorting allows to customize the order in which list/tree facets and individual facet items are provided. This allows consistent and client-tailored navigation through the Searchperience-generated facets. <br><br>Searchperience can handle two types of sorting: <br>- _Local sorting_: facet sorting based on some custom rules hard-coded inside the Searchperience Frontend. <br>- _External sorting_: facet sorting based on some custom rules defined outside of Searchperience, like in a Product Information Management(PIM) system, and indexed by Searchperience like any other type of data like products or brands. While Searchperience computes search results, it rearranges the order of facets on-the-fly based on the external sortings.<br><br>If an external sorting has been defined and provided to Searchperience, Searchperience will use it as a first choice, otherwise it will fallback to the local sorting. And as a very last resort, if no local sorting exists, a sorting by alphabetical order will be applied. 
| **Active by default. Configuration is needed.**                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Endpoint Configuration
| *Handle and manage different endpoints and the kind of information these provide.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Through the use of different endpoints it is possible to selectively search or filter for specific documents saved in the search engine. These [documents](glossary.md#document) might be brands, retailers, locations, products and so on. By using different endpoints, it is possible to manage and handle a large amount of information with ease. |
| **Some endpoints are default. Configuration is needed. Filters and facets can be customized differently for each endpoint.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Endpoints Documentation](glossary.md#endpoint)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Redirecting based on Query
| *Redirect users to specific location based on their search input.*                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When an exact match occurs between a search query and a specific word, such as a brand name, Searchperience can be configured to return a special response which can be used to guide users to specific parts in the online shop. |
| **No defaults. Matching type must be configured.**                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Redirect on Match Documentation](glossary.md#redirect-on-match)                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Product Teaser selection
| *Obtain precise product selection based on price or available product's variants used to tease products on all listing views.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Searchperience automatically manages and returns the up-to-date price information for a product and any of its variants. When handling filters and facets to narrow down search results, Searchperience will correctly find only products in which at least one variant matches the filtering criteria. Moreover, Searchperience will transform the product data to display the right variant when serving search results. This means that we do serve the most suitable version of that product information to teaser the size, color and price. |
| **Variant selection when using facets and filters is active by default. Further variant selection logic and price matching must be configured.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Indexer

### Document Transformation
| *Attach additional information to products even from external sources.*                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Document transformation allows to modify product's information. This information can include external data, such as selling information for sorting, to internal data, such as suggestion analysis, price or stock information. |
| **Default is to include price and stock information to products. Additional data sources are possible.**                                                                                                                        |

### Document Validation
| *Validate document properties and prevent irregular data from being saved in the search engine.*                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Document validation allows to verify product properties and recognize products with missing or false information. As a result, these products will not be saved in the search engine. |
| **Default example would be that a brand needs to be present. Additional rules need to be configured on demand.**                                                                      |

### Suggestion Extraction
| *Extract relevant terms from product's properties.*                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Suggestion extraction allows to obtain useful information based on product's properties and generate suggestion phrases which will be displayed to users when searching. These phrases are mainly used for autocompletion. |
| **Active by default. Properties used for the suggestion generation must be configured. We do include the title, category path, brand and retailer name or color names. Individual configuration possible.**                   |
